This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The function sometimes fails to trigger, even when a barcode is clearly scanned. This is intermittent and inconsistent, making it difficult to debug.  The issue seems related to timing or asynchronous operations within Expo's Camera component and the barcode scanning functionality.  No error messages are logged to the console.
