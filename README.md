# Expo Camera onBarCodeScanned Inconsistent Behavior

This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug in Expo's Camera API where the `onBarCodeScanned` function fails to consistently trigger when a barcode is scanned. The issue appears to be related to asynchronous operations and timing within the camera component.

## Bug Description

The `onBarCodeScanned` callback function provided to the `Camera` component does not always fire when barcodes are scanned. This leads to unreliable barcode reading capabilities.  No error messages are provided in the console.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Scan a barcode with the camera.  Notice that sometimes the barcode is correctly identified, but other times, it is not, even with the same barcode and lighting conditions.

## Solution (See bugSolution.js)

The proposed solution implements a debounce function to throttle the barcode scanning events, potentially mitigating the timing issue related to the asynchronous processing of barcode data.  This ensures some buffer time between multiple scans, potentially addressing a race condition. Additional error handling is also included.
